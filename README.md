### Test Labs


Note: For all test's names, please use `given when then` pattern
1. Just cover `DefaultCalculatorService` all methods with two or more cases, and divide to Zero case. `Don't use Spring`
2. Use `lab2` to cover logic. Create your own implementation for Repository inside tests. Cover all method and cases. `Don't use Spring and mokito`
3. For `lab3` use Mockito, just as `mock(Some Class)`
4. For `lab4` use Mockito, and extent with annotation
